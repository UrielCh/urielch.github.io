# My Github pages

Hi, After a decade of Java developpement, I was upset by the slow evolution of Java, I switch to `nodeJS` for my new project. It was hard to give up years of Java experience.

So I early adopted Typescript to keep strict typing; that was not easy at the time, because most projects had no typing.

Since, I convert to typescript most of the project I use if I do not find a proper typing in [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).

Within the almost 100 projects that I converted to typescript, 99% of them had bug reval by converting them to Typescript.

## There is some of my forked project
